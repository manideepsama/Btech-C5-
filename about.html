    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Considering the reports of WHO(world health organization), suicide is the
      second leading cause of death among 15-29 year ages across the world.A
      fact that every year approximately 8,00,000 losing there life due to
      suicide and the number gradually increasing year to year.while an
      individuaol suicide often had a devastating impact on there families.By
      understanding several suicdal cases few were preventable and its very
      important to study the different ways how the individuals are communicate
      there depression and solutions to prevent there deaths.
    </p>
    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>
      From years suicide cases are increasing rapidly and presence of suicidal
      ideation are difficult to known in an adult but in some cases its possible
      to predict the suicidal i9deation like tweets ,posts kept by an
      adult.Since this is known to us ,as a adult suffering with mental illness
      who needs a help.Its hard to find out tweets of each user and there are
      cases that systems are showls false results incases of wrong input.
    </p>
    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
    <p>
      In the world now a days the suicidal attempts has been going up and many
      people who decides to commit suicide to there cause of suicide to there
      knowns by means of twitter by tweets and now this is a quite familiar
      thing happening around us, those who are committing suicide are leaving a
      reason behind there decision by more number of tweets.and we can make it
      an advantage to get track of those tweets by developing a classifier which
      predicts whether it is positive or negative tweet from our detection
    </p>
